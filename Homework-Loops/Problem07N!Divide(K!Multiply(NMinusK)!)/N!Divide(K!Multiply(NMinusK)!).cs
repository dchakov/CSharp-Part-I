//Problem 7. Calculate N! / (K! * (N-K)!)
//In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k different members out of a group of n different elements
//(also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula: 
//formula For example, there are 2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards.
//Your task is to write a program that calculates n! / (k! * (n-k)!) for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Try to use only two loops.
//Examples:
//n	k	n! / (k! * (n-k)!)
//3	2	3
//4	2	6
//10	6	210
//52	5	2598960
